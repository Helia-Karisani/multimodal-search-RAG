# 🧠 Multimodal Search and RAG Systems

This repository presents a **six-step journey** through building intelligent **multimodal AI systems** — from foundational representation learning to advanced multimodal **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** and **recommender systems**.  
It explores how modern AI models can **understand, search, and reason across multiple data types** — including **text, images, audio, and video** — to build applications that combine perception and language understanding.

## 🎯 Project Purpose

Traditional RAG systems enhance large language models (LLMs) by incorporating external text data into their context.  
This project extends that idea to **multimedia data**, enabling LLMs to retrieve and reason over visual, auditory, and textual information simultaneously.

Through six progressive stages, you will learn how to:

- 🔹 Train and apply **contrastive learning** to embed multimodal data into shared vector spaces  
- 🔹 Implement **any-to-any multimodal search**, retrieving related content across different modalities  
- 🔹 Understand **visual instruction tuning**, where LLMs are trained to reason jointly over text and images  
- 🔹 Build an **end-to-end multimodal RAG pipeline** that analyzes retrieved multimedia context to generate meaningful responses  
- 🔹 Explore **industry applications** like document analysis, invoice understanding, and visual data extraction  
- 🔹 Design a **multi-vector recommender system** that compares cross-modal similarities to suggest relevant items

## 📁 Repository Overview

The repository is structured into six major folders — each representing a stage in the learning and implementation process:

```

Step-1  → Foundational multimodal embeddings and contrastive learning
Step-2  → Multimodal search and retrieval
Step-3  → Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) and visual instruction tuning
Step-4  → Building an end-to-end multimodal RAG system
Step-5  → Real-world and industry-level applications
Step-6  → Multi-vector multimodal recommender system

```

Each step includes **Jupyter notebooks, datasets, and helper scripts** that can be executed independently. Together, they form a complete end-to-end workflow — from **embedding multimodal data** to **retrieving and generating insights** with RAG and recommendation.

## ⚙️ Tools & Frameworks

*(To be added later — section reserved for listing tools, libraries, and frameworks used in the implementation.)*

By progressing through these six stages, you’ll gain practical skills to **embed, retrieve, and generate** across modalities — building a foundation to create smarter, context-aware multimodal AI systems.
