# 🧠 Multimodal Search and RAG Systems

This repository presents a **six-step journey** through building intelligent **multimodal AI systems** — from foundational representation learning to advanced multimodal **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** and **recommender systems**.
It explores how modern AI models can **understand, search, and reason across multiple data types** — including **text, images, audio, and video** — to build applications that combine perception and language understanding.

---

## 🎯 Project Purpose

Traditional RAG systems enhance large language models (LLMs) by incorporating external text data into their context.
This project extends that idea to **multimedia data**, enabling LLMs to retrieve and reason over visual, auditory, and textual information simultaneously.

Through six progressive stages, you will learn how to:

* 🔹 Train and apply **contrastive learning** to embed multimodal data into shared vector spaces
* 🔹 Implement **any-to-any multimodal search**, retrieving related content across different modalities
* 🔹 Understand **visual instruction tuning**, where LLMs are trained to reason jointly over text and images
* 🔹 Build an **end-to-end multimodal RAG pipeline** that analyzes retrieved multimedia context to generate meaningful responses
* 🔹 Explore **industry applications** like document analysis, invoice understanding, and visual data extraction
* 🔹 Design a **multi-vector recommender system** that compares cross-modal similarities to suggest relevant items

## 📁 Repository Overview

The repository is structured into six major folders — each representing a stage in the learning and implementation process:

```
Step-1 → Foundational multimodal embeddings and contrastive learning  
Step-2 → Multimodal search and retrieval  
Step-3 → Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) and visual instruction tuning  
Step-4 → Building an end-to-end multimodal RAG system  
Step-5 → Real-world and industry-level applications  
Step-6 → Multi-vector multimodal recommender system
```

Each step includes **Jupyter notebooks, datasets, and helper scripts** that can be executed independently.
Together, they form a complete end-to-end workflow — from **embedding multimodal data** to **retrieving and generating insights** with RAG and recommendation.

## 📦 Installation & Setup

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/multimodal-search-RAG.git
cd multimodal-search-RAG
```

### 2️⃣ Create a Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
EMBEDDING_API_KEY=your_palm_api_key_here
OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1
```

### 5️⃣ Launch Jupyter Notebook

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Then navigate to the corresponding folder (Step-1 → Step-6) and open the notebook of your choice.
